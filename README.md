# Waymo Open Dataset

We have released the Waymo Open Dataset publicly to aid the research community in making advancements in machine perception and autonomous driving technology.

The Waymo Open Dataset is composed of two datasets - the Perception dataset with high resolution sensor data and labels for 1,950 scenes, and the Motion dataset with object trajectories and corresponding 3D maps for 103,354 scenes.

## May 2022 Update
We released v1.3.2 of the Perception dataset to improve the quality and accuracy of the labels.
 - Updated 3D semantic segmentation labels, for better temporal consistency and to fix mislabeled points.
 - Updated 2D key point labels to fix image cropping issues.
 - Added `num_top_lidar_points_in_box` in [dataset.proto](waymo_open_dataset/dataset.proto) for the 3D Camera-Only Detection Challenge.

## April 2022 Update
We released v1.3.1 of the Perception dataset to support the 2022 Challenges and have updated this repository accordingly.
 - Added metrics (LET-3D-APL and LET-3D-AP) for the 3D Camera-Only Detection Challenge.
 - Added 80 segments of 20-second camera imagery, as a test set for the 3D Camera-Only Detection Challenge.
 - Added z-axis speed and acceleration in [lidar label metadata](waymo_open_dataset/label.proto#L53-L60).
 - Fixed some inconsistencies in `projected_lidar_labels` in [dataset.proto](waymo_open_dataset/dataset.proto).
 - Updated the default configuration for the Occupancy and Flow Challenge, switching from aggregate waypoints to [subsampled waypoints](waymo_open_dataset/protos/occupancy_flow_metrics.proto#L38-L55).
 - Updated the [tutorial](waymo-open-dataset/tutorial/tutorial_3d_semseg.ipynb) for 3D Semantic Segmentation Challenge with more detailed instructions.

## March 2022 Update

We released v1.3.0 of the Perception dataset and the 2022 challenges. We have updated this repository to add support for the new labels and the challenges.
 - Added 3D semantic segmentation labels, tutorial, and metrics.
 - Added 2D and 3D keypoint labels, tutorial, and metrics.
 - Added correspondence between 2D (camera) and 3D (lidar) labels (pedestrian only).
 - Added tutorial and utilities for Occupancy Flow Prediction Challenge.
 - Added the soft mAP metric for Motion Prediction Challenge.

## September 2021 Update

We released v1.1 of the Motion dataset to include lane connectivity information. To read more on the technical details, please read [lane_neighbors_and_boundaries.md](docs/lane_neighbors_and_boundaries.md).
 - Added lane connections. Each lane has a list of lane IDs that enter or exit the lane.
 - Added lane boundaries.  Each lane has a list of left and right boundary features associated with the lane and the segment of the lane where the boundary is active.
 - Added lane neighbors. Each lane has a list of left and right neighboring lanes.  These are lanes an agent may make a lane change into.
 - Improved timestamp precision.
 - Improved stop sign Z values.

## March 2021 Update

We expanded the Waymo Open Dataset to also include a Motion dataset comprising object trajectories and corresponding 3D maps for over 100,000 segments. We have updated this repository to add support for this new dataset. Please refer to the [Quick Start](docs/quick_start.md).

Additionally, we added instructions and examples for the real-time detection challenges. Please follow these [Instructions](waymo_open_dataset/latency/README.md).

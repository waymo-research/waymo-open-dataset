"Works" means the code distributed by Waymo LLC (“Waymo”) at
https://github.com/waymo-research/waymo-open-dataset/third_party/sim_agents_metrics.
Patents Pending: U.S. Patent App No. 18/603,102 , U.S. Patent App No. 63/563,894

Waymo hereby grants to you a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, personal
patent license to make, have made, use, import, and otherwise transfer the
Works, where such license applies only to those patent claims, both currently
owned by Waymo and acquired in the future, licensable by Waymo that are
necessarily infringed by the Works when you use the Works to process the data
from the Waymo Open Dataset (available at https://waymo.com/open) for
evaluation of the Sim Agents Challenge, as authorized by and in compliance with
the Waymo Dataset License Agreement for Non-Commercial Use. This grant does
not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modification of the Works. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute
or order or agree to the institution of patent litigation or any other patent
enforcement activity against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Works or any code incorporated within the Works
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of patent
infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this license for
the Works shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
